					My name is Bo Wilkins, and I am many things. First and foremost, I am a pet, but I am also the first Black Labrador to run for the position of President of the United States. I am a native Texan born in Houston in 2007 to an unknown owner. At the age of two years, I was hit by a car near Katy, and I was taken to an animal rescue facility. Many months later, I found myself in the care of the Wilkins family. Since that day, I have been a dedicated advocate of food and eating, as well as being petted. I hope to share this joy I have found with the rest of the country as President. Allow me to give you some of the reasons I am qualified for this office.
