				<h3>These are the positions that I take on the many issues that candidates must face</h3>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Climate Change</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					I know all too well the devastating effects of climate change. Sometimes, in the afternon, the water in my water bowl is so hot that it burns my tongue. I am, therefore, in favor of bipartisan lgegislation that would cool off people's water bowls, but that would not regulate what kinds of water bowls people can buy.
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Church and State</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					I am not in favor of the separation of church and Steak. Why is it that the government believes it has the right to tell me whether I can or cannot eat steak in church? Isn't that up to the church involved?
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Foreign Relations</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					I am especially proud of my experience in this area! I have travelled to many foreign countries, including: the garage, the doctor's office, the pet salon, and the neighbor man's backyard! As president, I'll be realy nice to al the people at those places so that theyd on't bite us and they give us pettins. I also undersand that Iran has a "new clear deal." When I figure out what this "new clear deal" is, I'll let you know how I can get it to pet us!
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Response to Foreign Military Aggression</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					In my many years in the Backyard, many threats have reared their heads. They have threatened my life, the lives of my siblings, and indeed the lives of my owners. These threats include: squirrels, birds, little frogs, big frogs, tutles, the dogs that live next door, the old basset hound that sometimes escapes, kitty cats, the garbage truck, running women, and many other dogs who have dared to approach our borders. I have found that the best solution for dealing with foreign military aggression is to bark at it for a little while, and eventually it will go away. As president, I will implement this policy in the face of all foreign aggression.
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Education</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					It is so easy to learn how to get your belly rubbed. But until we put more funding into education, millions will be denied the belly rubbing they deserve. By the time I leave office, I will be known as "President Bellyrub!!!".
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Taxation</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					Whenever I try to eat some of Spare Dog's food, I get yelled at, and they tell me to eat my own food. But I'm still hungry after I eat my own food, and Spare Dog doesn't even eat it. As president, I would passs legislation allowing people who are still hungry to eat someone else's food if they don't want it.
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Gun Control</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					I'm a hunting dog. Connect the dots. 
				</span>
				<h4 class="issuesheading">Healthcare</h4>
				<span class="issuestext">
					I don't like going to the vet. Sometimes, my owners get me in the car and I think they're going to take me for a walk, but then we go to the vet. As president, I will make sure that no American ever has to go to the vet!
